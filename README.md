# Cuda-Kernels

This repository contains CUDA implementations of various algorithms, primarily focused on deep learning.  

I am currently ranked in the **Top 20** (as of this commit) on [leetgpu.com](https://leetgpu.com), and this repo contains the kernels I’ve implemented.  

A Google Colab notebook is also provided for profiling using `cudaEvent` and Nsight Compute. 
Happy learning and profiling !
